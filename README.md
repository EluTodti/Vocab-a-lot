# Vocab-a-lot
Our attempt to create a multiplayer game about beaming, fighting and vocabulary.

Our vision
The idea of the game is a combination of three different components:

- Struggle as a type of fun
- Compete to progress
- Learn while playing

We want to make a game, that is enjoyable and addictive and this is our objective number one. That is why we want our players to struggle and fail over and over again. It might sound crazy at first, but that is what makes games so much fun.

We are also planning to create a multiplayer experience in order to make a competition out of this game. In doing so we are challenging the player to achieve mastery in our game and become better at it than any of her friends.

Last but not least, we want to fill the game with educational content, because we believe that playing is the best way to learn. The use case we have picked is learning english vocabulary which we, non-native speakers, have all struggled with at different points of our lives. With our game we want to make it less of a painful experience and more of a cool side effect of an entertaining activity, which, we hope, Vocab a lot is going to become.
